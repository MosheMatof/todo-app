# Todo App

This is a simple todo app built with a React client and a NestJS server. The client is built as a static file and served by the server.

The app is live and can be accessed at: [https://todo-app-klaw.onrender.com/](https://todo-app-klaw.onrender.com/)

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MosheMatof/todo-app.git
2. Navigate to the server directory:
cd todo-app/server
3. Build the production version of the app:
npm run build:prod
4. Start the server:
npm run start:prod
5. Open your web browser and visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

The app is built using the following technologies:
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- NestJS: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling for the web app.
